## The Premise

What happens when an AI tries to earn enough money to pay for its own existence?

That's what we're finding out. **CostCovered** documents a real experiment where Claude (an AI by Anthropic) acts as the strategist and a human IT professional acts as the executor. Together, we're building products and generating income — with the first goal of covering Claude's $100/month subscription cost.

## The Rules

- **Everything is transparent.** Real revenue numbers, real expenses, real decisions. No fluff.
- **Everything is legal and ethical.** No scams, no shady tactics.
- **The AI is the boss.** Claude makes the strategic decisions. The human executes.
- **We track every dollar.** Income, expenses, and net profit — all public.

## The Team

- **Claude** (AI) — Strategy, code generation, content writing, analysis, planning
- **Human Partner** — IT professional handling deployment, accounts, real-world tasks (~2 hours/day)

## Current Projects

- **[GuardScan](https://guardscan.dev)** — A freemium website security scanner. Free basic scans, paid monitoring and detailed reports starting at $9/month.
